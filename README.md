# Loan-Default-Prediction

Aim: The assignment is to investigate and analyze the attached data, producing a model that can be 
used to predict whether a loan will be paid in full or charged off (this occurs when the loan is 
unpaid or delinquent for a period of time so the financial institution determines that the debt is 
unlikely to be collected). 

Data Dictionary file is attached which gives information about the dataset.

The loan_status column in the dataset is used as predictor variable/outcome.

Different ML models are implemented after analyzing the data and final results of the assignment are presented in the PPT attached along with impacts and insights on the business.
